# Runbook: Generate a proof post (dashboard)

1. Log in to the dashboard.
2. Go to **Proof** (sidebar).
3. In “Generate proof post”, select the **Lead** you want a proof post for.
4. Click **Generate**. The post appears below (6–10 lines: what I saw → cost → what I changed → result → “comment CHECKLIST”).
5. Click **Copy** and paste where you share (e.g. LinkedIn, thread). No auto-send; human posts only.

**Checklist:** When someone comments CHECKLIST, go to **Checklist** → optionally enter keywords → **Generate checklist** → copy and share from the UI. No auto-DM, no auto-email.
