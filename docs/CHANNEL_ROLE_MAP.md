# Channel Role Map (Strategy)

**Purpose:** Define the *role* of each channel so we can spot imbalance (e.g. only reach, no authority; no owned-audience capture). Used by the weekly Channel Role critique.

## Roles (dimensions)

- **Reach** — visibility, impressions, new eyeballs
- **Authority** — expertise, credibility, “who is this person?”
- **Trust** — warmth, proof, testimonials, safety
- **Owned-audience capture** — moving people to email/newsletter/owned list
- **Conversion support** — moves prospects toward proposal/close

## By channel

| Channel | Reach | Authority | Trust | Owned-audience capture | Conversion support |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------|------------------------|--------------------|
| LinkedIn | High | High | Medium | Low (profile only) | High (DMs, warm intro) |
| YouTube | High | High | Medium | Medium (subscribe) | Low (funnel to link) |
| TikTok | High | Medium | Low | Low | Low |
| Instagram | High | Medium | Medium | Low | Low |
| X (Twitter) | Medium | High | Medium | Low | Medium (replies, DMs) |
| Threads | Medium | Medium | Low | Low | Low |
| Networking Event | Low | High | High | Medium (exchange emails) | High (live follow-up) |
| Referral | Low | High | High | N/A | High |
| Newsletter | Low | High | High | **Primary** | High (CTA, reply) |
| Other | — | — | — | — | — |

## Imbalance warnings (weekly critique)

The system flags:

1. **Only reach, no authority** — Lots of content on reach channels (LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok) but no authority-building (how-tos, case patterns, lessons).
2. **No owned-audience capture** — No newsletter signups, no “reply to this” capture; all traffic stays on platforms.
3. **No conversion support** — Activity doesn’t point to next step (proposal, call, reply).
