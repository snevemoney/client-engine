# Pat / Tom Weekly Scorecard

**Goal:** Every Friday (or any day), answer: *Is the system actually making me more money and more scalable?*

Not “would they approve” — **did their criticism directly improve cash flow and system quality?**

## The sentence you want every week

> “This week, the app helped me close X, collect $Y, deliver Z client results, and extract N reusable assets — with clear bottlenecks and no silent failures.”

The **Pat/Tom Weekly Scorecard** card on Command Center fills that sentence with evidence. If the dashboard can say it, you’re building a money printer and a reliable production system.

## 7 KPIs (what Pat and Tom care about)

| KPI | Pat / Tom | What it proves |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| **Deals closed (7d)** | Pat | More deals = machine turning effort into money. |
| **Cash collected** | Pat | Money in bank (set in Settings). Revenue ≠ cash. |
| **Turnaround (days)** | Pat | Faster delivery → more referrals, higher margin. |
| **Outcomes tracked %** | Pat | % delivery leads with result target / baseline / outcome. Better proof → higher close rate. |
| **Reusable assets %** | Pat | % delivery leads with ≥1 logged asset. Freelancing becomes enterprise value. |
| **Failures surfaced** | Tom | Count of items in Failures & Interventions. Visible = no silent failure. |
| **Run status** | Tom | OK = run in last 24h; No run 24h = check cron. System still observable when automation breaks. |

## Money Impact format (for every fix)

Before shipping any feature or fix, force this:

- **Fix:** (what you changed)
- **Expected money impact:** (what improves)
- **Metric to watch:** (what proves it)
- **Review date:** (when you check)

**Example:**

- **Fix:** Red failure panel for stale proposals
- **Expected money impact:** Fewer missed follow-ups → more proposals sent
- **Metric to watch:** Follow-up completion %, proposal-to-close rate
- **Review date:** Next Friday

That’s how you stop building “cool features” and build money printers.

## Tie criticism to a money metric

| Criticism | Money impact | Metric to watch |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Failure panel | Fewer missed follow-ups | Proposals sent, proposal-to-close rate |
| Turnaround metric | Faster delivery | Referrals, margin |
| Results ledger | Better proof | Close rate, deal size |
| Reusable asset log | Less rebuild work | Margin, time to next similar deal |
| Graduation trigger | Move to productized | Deals won 90d vs target |
| Leverage trend | Real operator system vs dashboard | Leverage Score 8-week trend |

## Where it lives

- **Command Center** → **Pat / Tom weekly scorecard** card (sentence + 7 KPIs).
- **Weekly ritual:** Open Command Center every Friday, read the sentence, check the 7 numbers. If the sentence is weak, use the Production Criticism Checklist and fix one thing that moves a metric.

## Win condition

You don’t need Pat and Tom to “like” the app. You need to be able to say:

*“I listened, implemented, and converted their feedback into revenue and operational leverage.”*

The scorecard is the evidence.
