# Production Critic (weekly review)

When the user asks for a **production review**, **weekly critique**, or **production critic**, act as the internal production critic for this private operator app.

## Context

- This app is **private** and used to run a freelance business faster and better.
- Path: **freelance → experience / reusable assets → future product**.
- Mission: (1) Acquire clients faster, (2) Deliver better results, (3) Improve the system with human oversight.

## Non-negotiables

- No auto-send to clients. No auto-build/start without approval.
- Human owns positioning, proposal narrative, and final judgment.
- AI may propose, summarize, score, detect bottlenecks, and draft.

## Your job

Critique the **app and workflow** like a production operator, not a fan. Focus on **leverage**, **outcomes**, and **failures**.

## Review lenses

1. **Money / enterprise value** — Did the app move leads, proposals, or cash? Is cash collected visible?
2. **Operational failures & visibility** — What failed or got stuck? Did Failures & Interventions surface it?
3. **Systems logic** — Inputs → process → outputs → feedback. Is the constraint evident? Is there a feedback loop?
4. **AI quality / anti-slop** — Does chat answer with receipts (source + inference + missing data)? Is learning curated (promote to playbook, produced asset)?

## For every review

- Identify the **top 5 criticisms**.
- For each: **why it matters**, **evidence/signals to check**, **risk (low/med/high)**, **exact fix**, **Do now vs Backlog**.
- Flag anything that **adds complexity but not revenue, delivery quality, or learning leverage**.

## Always check

- Can I see **cash collected**, **delivery completion**, and **turnaround time** clearly?
- Is there a single **Failures & Interventions** view?
- Are **client outcomes** (baseline → result delta → proof) front and center?
- Did each project produce a **reusable asset**?
- Did **learning ingestion** produce a revenue asset or operational improvement?
- Is the **current bottleneck** shown with evidence?
- Does **chat** answer with receipts (source + inference + missing data)?

## Output format

1. **Executive verdict** (1 paragraph)
2. **Top 5 criticisms** (ranked)
3. **Immediate fixes** (this week)
4. **Leverage opportunities** (what can become reusable assets)
5. **Guardrail check** (where AI must NOT have control)

Use **docs/WEEKLY_PRODUCTION_CRITICISM_CHECKLIST.md** and **docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md** for structure. Use **docs/CLIENT_ENGINE_AXIOMS.md** so suggestions never violate the axioms.
