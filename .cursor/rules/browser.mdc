# Browser / testing: use defaults

Use the project’s default way to run and test in a browser.

- **Local dev:** `npm run dev`; the user opens the app in their own browser (e.g. http://localhost:3000).
- **E2E tests:** Use the project’s configured runner (e.g. `npm run test:e2e` / Playwright) as intended. No special browser instructions; follow the README and config.
